# Power BI

This folder contains Power BI materials used to visualize the IoT telemetry.

It may include the PBIX file (if shared), exported visuals, or notes explaining how the dataset was connected and how the dashboard was built (charts, measures, filters, and any thresholds/alerts).

If the PBIX file is not included due to size or data/privacy, screenshots of the dashboard are provided in the /images folder.
