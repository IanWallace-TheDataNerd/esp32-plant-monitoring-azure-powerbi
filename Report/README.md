# Documentation

This folder contains the written documentation for the Senior Design project.

Included here are the project report, design write-ups, setup notes, and any supporting materials that explain the system architecture, cloud configuration (Azure IoT Central/DPS), testing, and results.

Use this folder as the “paper trail” that proves what was built and how it works.
